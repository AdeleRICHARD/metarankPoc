# Autogenerated config file for Metarank, source=/input/events.jsonl
#
# This config file may need to be edited manually:
# - persistence config is not defined. Metarank will run in an in-memory mode by default.
# - generated feature definitions for categories may include too many/few items.
# - model training hyperparameters may not be perfect for your dataset, so you may need to tune them.
